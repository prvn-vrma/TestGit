Git have their own local repository which is not in svn. Which have one central repo.

So if person is unable to connect to server central repo or dont have internet then have to copy code somewhere and have
to wait for internet to come.

With Subversion, you have a Problem: The SVN Repository may be in a location you can't reach 
(in your company, and you don't have internet at the moment), you cannot commit. 
If you want to make a copy of your code, you have to literally copy/paste it.
